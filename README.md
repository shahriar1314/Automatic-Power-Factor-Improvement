# Automatic-Power-Factor-Improvement
Automatic power factor improvement using arduino uno

## Background 

Power factor is the ration of Active power (or the actual electrical power dissipated by an AC circuit) to the total power (the product of the rms value of current and voltage). 

Low power factor results in poor electrical efficiency, higher utility bills and higher line losses. Thus improvement of power factor upto a certain value is emmninet. Normally we improve power factor adding capacitor bank. 
In this project I will try to use arduino uno to automatize the connectivity of the capacitor bank to improve the power factor up to 0.95 in Proteus 8.7 software.
